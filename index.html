 </p>Interests of Engineering:</p>
</p>I've always been interested in how computers and video games work. Since I was little, I loved playing games on my computer and wondered how they were made. This curiosity led me to want to study and understand the concept of computer science, where I got to learn about how to create software and write code. I enjoyed working on different projects throughout the whole school year because it helped me realize how important computer science is. Through these projects, I have gained valuable insights into different aspects of problem-solving, explored various coding platforms, and learned to consider the needs of diverse user groups. Each project has been a unique learning opportunity, contributing to my growth and reinforcing my passion for this field. I have learned the importance of precision, creativity, and adaptability in coding. Reflecting on my year, I can strongly say that my journey through computers has been rewarding. The knowledge and skills I have developed in this class gave me a deeper understanding of this field.</p>
</p>Reflecting on this year, I can confidently say that my journey through computer science has been rewarding. The knowledge and skills I've acquired have not only equipped me with the technical skills needed for the field but also helped me a deeper understanding of its potential impact. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue advancing along the computer science pathway. Next year, I am planning on taking CSP. This field has delighted me, and I am eager to take the next steps, deepening my knowledge and sharpening my skills. I hope to eventually pursue a career in computer science, where I can leverage my passion and expertise to make a meaningful impact. One of the most valuable aspects of this class was the opportunity to collaborate with different kinds of people. Working with different individuals taught me different lessons about teamwork and communication. While it’s true you don’t always get to choose your teammates and may sometimes work with people you might not get along with, I’ve come to appreciate that everyone brings unique strengths and mindsets to the table. This retaliation has helped me to be more adaptable and open-minded in many ways.</p>
